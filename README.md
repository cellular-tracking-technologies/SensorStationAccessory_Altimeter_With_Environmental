# SensorStation Accessory: Altimeter with Environmental Monitoring

This SensorStation accessory features the Bosch BME680, allowing you to monitor your local environment! The accessory also allows
you to calibrate the altimeters of wildlife telemetry devices.

The BME680 is an integrated environmental sensor that provides the following:

* Pressure (altimeter grade)
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Gas sensing (VOC's)

When used with a properly vented encosure, you can use SensorStation to monitor the weather as well as air quality.

When used inside a tight, waterproof enclosure, the BME680 can provide additional clues on the health of your SensorStation. For example:

Increasing humidity would indicate a leak of your waterproof case, connections, or other water hazards that could damage your SensorStation

High temperature conditions may indicate more cooling is needed, or the enclosure should be relocated to the shade

Gas sensing could indicate a future problem with an electronic component or potential battery failure
